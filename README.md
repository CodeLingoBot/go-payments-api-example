# Go API Payments Example

This repository contains an example of a payments API implemented with Go serving the purpose of an example with the packages, tools, technologies, etc. that are used.

NOTE the packages, tools, technologies, etc., will be listed in the future when the first implementation be done; any other important information to highlight will be added to this document too.

## Goal

Implement, in Go, a small example of a payment RESTful API which allows to:

* Create, read, update and delete a payment.
* Get a list of payments.

## Considerations

The project will be used in the future of a base of experimentation for improving several topics, between some of them, API designs, Software Patterns, DDD (Domain Driven Development), modularity, simplicity.

However all of those changes will be done through the time under my needs and curiosities and without any commitment and iterative in order to have have "releases".
